## 🛡️ What Are AI Guardrails?

AI guardrails are automated checks that prevent common issues when AI generates or modifies code. They ensure:

- **Code Quality**: Consistent formatting, proper documentation, maintainable structure
- **Security**: No secrets in code, proper input validation, secure practices
- **Type Safety**: Strong typing, no unsafe casts, proper error handling
- **Performance**: File size limits, complexity checks, bundle optimization
- **Best Practices**: Enforced patterns, naming conventions, architectural standards

## 🎯 Who Should Use This?

- **Teams working with AI assistants** (GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, etc.)
- **Projects that need consistent code quality**
- **Teams that want to reduce code review friction**
- **Developers who want to prevent technical debt**
